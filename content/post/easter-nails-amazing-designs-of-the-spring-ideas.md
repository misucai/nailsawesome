### Candy Glitter Nails

And one more way to add a playful and easy mood to your Easter nails is simply to use some glitter polish. For a cute spring manicure you do not need to cover your nails with a thick layer of glitter – this will only weight their outward. Simply apply one or two layers of this coating to the base of your favorite color and you are ready for the meeting of spring and all the long-awaited holidays!
